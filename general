A major scale is formed by the pattern W W h W W W h
Starting with open E we can build the E Major scale

The chromatic scale is Ab A Bb B C Db D Eb E F Gb G (or E F Gb G Ab A Bb B C Db D Eb)
Each note (in the scale ^) is a half-step
So, if we start on Open E and play each fret in order, on the 5th fret you are playing A

Each time you get to the end of the chromatic scale and 'wrap around'; that is an `octave`

If you start on Open E and play each fret (only on that one string) -- that is the chromatic scale

The open strings are E A D G B E

The 2nd string (played open) is A (instead of s1:f5 [E5]).

Most music is written around what is known as the "Middle C" (http://www.piano-keyboard-guide.com/images/piano-notes.jpg for piano)

This just means that Middle C is the 'center octave' or 'standard' pitch for music.


[Definition]
Scale: A set of notes in a particular order without a specific octave

'b' is flat -- '#' is sharp
flat is relative to the next key, sharp is relative to the previous
Meaning: Db is also C# (C# is C + 1 half-step)


*** C-Major ***

A B C D E F G

* Defined in chromatic order

When we write music we talk about it by using the scale as a 'key'.

[Definition]
Key: A scale that is not necessarily in chromatic order

Think of it this way: scale = C# List (ordered), key = C# Dictionary (unordered)

If you play a song that uses all 12 notes you are playing in the Chromatic Key.
